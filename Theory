In jQuery it is very easy to select an element and change its properties like in js fist we select an element by querySelectorAll() and then change its properties like.
var a =document.querySelectorAll("h1");
a.style.backgroundColor("pink")
------But in jQuery we use "$" to select an item and .css to change its properties:
$("h1").css("color","pink");
--------OR------ we can add group of properties like- 
var styles={background:"pink",
  border : 2px solid red,
  fontWeight: "bold"
};
$("h1").css(styles);   //And it'll change all its properties
We can also change properties according to class or ids or tag name.
$("#a").css("color","red");
